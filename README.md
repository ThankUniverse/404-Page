A Page 404 with an image modified on Photoshop
The picture have an escalator showed upside-down with a screen facing a little point of water.
The purpose is to twist the mind of the visitor in a way for him to understand that something turns wrong on the page.
A pink-redish 404 text appear like a "code-bar" (only visible on windows Edge actually)
There is also a glow effect on the screen added to the image.
#
Next version 1.2 will propose some added element in the image (maybe interactive?) 
Like some women around the swimming pool, 
An animal in the escalator and some christmas light coming on the first plan.

1.3 will add a text stunning effect and add some interactive elements.
