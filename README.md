A Page 404 with an image modified on Photoshop</br>
The picture have an escalator showed upside-down with a screen facing a little point of water.</br>
The purpose is to twist the mind of the visitor in a way for him to understand that something turns wrong on the page.</br>
A pink-redish 404 text appear like a "code-bar" (only visible on windows Edge actually)</br>
There is also a glow effect on the screen added to the image.</br>
#
Next version 1.2 will propose some added element in the image (maybe interactive?)</br>
Like some women around the swimming pool, an animal in the escalator and some christmas light coming on the first plan.</br>

1.3 will add a text stunning effect and add some interactive elements.</br>
